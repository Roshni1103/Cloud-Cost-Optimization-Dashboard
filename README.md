# Cloud Cost Optimization Dashboard 💸☁️

> A Power BI project to analyze AWS cloud spending and provide actionable cost optimization insights.

---

## 📊 Project Summary

This project simulates a real-world cloud billing environment. Using mock AWS billing data, we created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to identify high-cost services, inefficient usage, and potential cost-saving recommendations — just like a Data or Cloud Business Analyst would do.
